Introduction to for and while loops.
How loops work in Python.
Using loops with collections (lists, tuples, etc.).

Ans:
------------------------------FOR LOOP -----------------------------------
->In Python, a ‘for loop‘ is used to iterate over a sequence of items, such as a Python tuple, list, string, or range. The loop will execute a block of 
statements for each item in the sequence.

EXAMPLE:
# Create a list of items 
items = ['pen', 'notebook', 
        'pencil', 'lunch box'] 
  
# Run a loop to print 
# items in a list 
for item in items: 
    print(item)


------------------------------WHILE LOOP -----------------------------------
->In Python, a while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements 
while a condition is true. The loop will continue to run as long as the 
condition remains true.
# Create a list of items 
items = ['pen', 'notebook', 
         'pencil', 'lunch box'] 
  
# Declare a index 
index = 0
  
# Store length of items list 
items_len = len(items) 
  
# Run a loop to print 
# items in a list 
while index<items_len: 
    print(items[index]) 
    index = index+1
